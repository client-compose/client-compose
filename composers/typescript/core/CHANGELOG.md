# @client-compose/composer

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4e7aae0`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/4e7aae086212b9b0bb21944d51462d83f6f8ceef) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Screen `meta` and `not_found` (spec §4, §4.3):
  
  - Responses can carry optional `meta` (`title`, `description`, `image`) describing the screen as a
    whole, from a screen's new `meta` function, which runs alongside the islands and shares their loads.
  - A layout throwing `NotFoundError` (or a batch loader's missing key) responds 404 `not_found`,
    distinct from `unknown_screen`. `ScreenFetchError` now exposes the protocol error `code`.
  - New `onLayoutError` and `onMetaError` composer options; two new conformance cases.
  - `@client-compose/react` re-exports `ScreenMeta`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`55613c9`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/55613c91f661064f9856b1654c08c47a697a64f4) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Request-scoped data loading. `rc.load(key, fn)` (on resolver and layout contexts) runs `fn` once per
  key per screen request and shares the result with every island and the layout; the work runs under
  the request's signal, so an island timing out never cancels work other islands are waiting on, and
  whatever is still running is cancelled once the response is ready. `defineBatchLoader` combines and
  de-duplicates keys requested by different islands into one call. Also exports `LayoutContext`.
