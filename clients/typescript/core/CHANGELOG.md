# @client-compose/client

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/pull/16) [`d736b2f`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/d736b2ff986f36257d40775e9ee55b7423f81c61) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Tighter types: `IslandRenderer` and island entries default their props to `unknown` instead of
  `any`, and `registerComponent` takes props that are objects (as generated props types are).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/pull/12) [`f07f193`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/f07f193938f4862a7354da8c4d40d7ed5d8ade7e) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Send screens and actions through your own server. `@client-compose/client/proxy`'s `createComposerProxy` is the server half (e.g. inside Next.js Server Actions): it checks what the browser sent, sets the client context and headers (such as a session from an httpOnly cookie), lets you see and change each action's response, and returns failures as data. `viaProxy` in `@client-compose/react` is the browser half: it turns those functions into the config's `fetch` and `performAction`.
  
  `installFakeGateway(handlers)` in `@client-compose/client/testing` (and `@client-compose/react/testing`) installs the fake composer as the global `fetch`, for code that fetches by itself; `restore()` puts the original back.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/pull/10) [`1689cf4`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/1689cf4cdedf27677171f3c88b75252cfd472752) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Testing helpers and action error helpers.
  
  - `@client-compose/client/testing`: `createFakeGateway`, a fake composer that answers screen and action requests from handlers and records them, and response builders typed by generated descriptors (`island`, `islandError`, `screen`, `screenError`, `actionOk`, `actionError`, `actionFailure`).
  - `@client-compose/react/testing`: everything above, plus `createTestConfig`, a provider config for tests that uses the fake composer and records `navigate` and `invalidate` effects.
  - `@client-compose/react`: `declaredError(result)` and `isUnexpected(result, handled)` for showing how an action call ended.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8bd6c78`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/8bd6c78c377b4f5dd048d784145475adfcdb2b5d) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Actions (spec §5): `callAction` performs an action with its generated descriptor and resolves with its typed outcome; `ActionFetchError` for non-2xx responses; `buildActionRequest`, `fetchAction` and `newIdempotencyKey`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`8bd6c78`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/8bd6c78c377b4f5dd048d784145475adfcdb2b5d)]:
  - @client-compose/protocol@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4e7aae0`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/4e7aae086212b9b0bb21944d51462d83f6f8ceef) Thanks [@LewisYearsley](https://github.com/LewisYearsley)! - Screen `meta` and `not_found` (spec §4, §4.3):
  
  - Responses can carry optional `meta` (`title`, `description`, `image`) describing the screen as a
    whole, from a screen's new `meta` function, which runs alongside the islands and shares their loads.
  - A layout throwing `NotFoundError` (or a batch loader's missing key) responds 404 `not_found`,
    distinct from `unknown_screen`. `ScreenFetchError` now exposes the protocol error `code`.
  - New `onLayoutError` and `onMetaError` composer options; two new conformance cases.
  - `@client-compose/react` re-exports `ScreenMeta`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`4e7aae0`](https://github.com/client-compose/client-compose/commit/4e7aae086212b9b0bb21944d51462d83f6f8ceef)]:
